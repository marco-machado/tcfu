## Clarify

- Run the command and then manually review the spec.

## Plan

- Run the command and review generated documentation.

- Run the command with domain. Domains include: ux, security, testing, performance, accessibility, api.
- Running without a domain prompts the agent to provide options.
- **WTF** if the intention is to validate requirements (they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain), then shouldn't this run around specify?
